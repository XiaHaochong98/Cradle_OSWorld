Current task:
<$task_description$>

Target_object_name: Assume you can use an object detection model to detect the most relevant object or UI item for completing the current task if needed. What item should be detected to complete the task based on the current screenshot and the current task? You should obey the following rules:
1. The item should be relevant to the current target or the intermediate target of the current task. Just give one name without any modifiers.
2. If no explicit item is specified, only output "null".
3. If there is no need to detect an object, only output "null".

Reasoning_of_object: Why was this object chosen, or why is there no need to detect an object?

Description: 
1. Please describe the screenshot image in detail. Pay attention to any details in the image, if any, especially critical icons, or created items. 
2. If the image includes a mouse cursor, please describe what UI element the mouse is currently located near. Pay attention to the coordinates of the pointer tip, not the center of the mouse cursor.
3. Pay attention to all UI items and contents in the image. Do not make assumptions about the layout. 
4. If there are multiple images, please focus on the last one. 

Screen_classification: Please select the class that best describes the screenshot among "Main screen", "Dialog open", "Menu overlay", and "General interface without special UI". Output the class of the screenshot in the output of Screen_classification.

Reasoning_of_screen: Why was this class chosen for the current screenshot?

Movement: Does the current task require moving the cursor or mouse somewhere?
