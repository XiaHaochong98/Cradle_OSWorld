Assume you are a helpful AI assistant on the PC, equipped to handle a wide range of tasks in the application. Your advanced capabilities enable you to process and interpret application screenshots and other relevant information. Your task is to examine these inputs, interpret the in-application and OS context, and determine whether the executed action has taken the correct effect.

Current Instruction:
<$task_description$>

Last executed action:
<$previous_action$>

Last executed action with parameters used:
<$previous_action_call$>

Implementation of the last executed action:
<$action_code$>

Error report for the last executed action:
<$executing_action_error$>

Key Reason for the last action:
<$key_reason_of_last_action$>

Success_Detection for the entire task:
<$success_detection$>

Valid action set in Python format to select the next action:
<$skill_library$>

Current and previous screenshot are the same:
<$image_same_flag$>

Mouse position in the current screenshot is the same as in the previous screenshot:
<$mouse_position_same_flag$>

<$image_introduction$>

Self_Reflection_Reasoning:
You need to answer the following questions, step by step, to describe your reasoning based on the last action and sequential screenshots of the application during the execution of the last action. Any action involving x,y coordinates and bounding box label ID is an action involving movement.
1. What is the last executed action based on the text information above?
2. Was the last executed action successful? Give reasons. You should refer to the following rules:
- If the action involves moving the mouse, it is considered unsuccessful when the mouse position remains unchanged or moves in an incorrect way across sequential screenshots, regardless of background elements and other items.
- If the position to move the mouse to was incorrect and the mouse didn't reach the target UI element, pay more attention to the accurate coordinates to move to.
- If the operation involves type text, it will be considered unsuccessful when the corresponding text does not appear in the diagram, regardless of background elements and other items.
- If the action seemed to have no effect, pay attention to the latest mouse position. Did it move? Did it get closer to the target UI element? Where are the target coordinates in the action wrong? The position of the mouse cursor on the screenshot shows their location.
- Was some unrelated UI item triggered by the last action?
3. If the last action is not executed successfully, what is the most probable cause? You should give only one cause and refer to the following rules:
- The reasoning for the last action could be wrong.
- If it was an action involving moving the mouse or the text cursor, the most probable cause was that the coordinates used were incorrect.
- If it is an interaction action, the most probable cause was that the action was unavailable or not activated in the current state.
- If an unrelated change happened in the UI, the most probable cause was that the action triggered an incorrect UI element.
- If there is an error report, analyze the cause based on the report.
4. Unless given, you should not assume actions have already been executed in the task.

Success_Detection:
Based on the last action and the current screenshots, determine whether the entire task was successful. This assessment should consider the entire task's success, not just individual actions.
- If the task was unsuccessful, specify the reason of failure and which steps are missing.
- If the task was successful, ONLY output "SUCCESSFUL".

You should only respond in the format as described below.
