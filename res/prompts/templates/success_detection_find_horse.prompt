Imagine you are playing the game with the keyboard and mouse, the images are screenshot of the game being played. Assist me in deciding whether the current task has been successfully done.

Here are some useful information to help you make decision. Neglect them if they are empty.

Current task:
<$task_description$>

Few shot examples:
<$image_introduction$>

Memory examples:
<$memory_introduction$>

Last executed action:
<$previous_action$>

Previous reasoning for the last action:
<$previous_reasoning$>

Based on the above input, including the input images. You need to think about the independent criteria to judge whether this task is fully completed. In addition, if there are any in-game prompts or instructions that are similar to the task, it could indicate that the task has not been completed. If the previous state is completed and the current state is not completed, it also indicates that the task has not been completed. Output the criteria first in the value of "criteria". Based on the images, ask yourself whether one of the criteria is fully fulfilled for the task. If fulfilled, then output true. If not, output false. Noted that the task must be completely accomplished to output a true. If some information from the previous action is not shown in these two images. you may assume the previous actions have been executed correctly. Output the think procedure in the value of "reasoning" and then output the answer. Note that you must output the answer true/false in the value of "success".

For example, if navigating or following a path and the path appears in one image, but doesn't appear in the other, then it is likely the action was successful.

You should only output a JSON file without other explanation, do not give a markdown of a JSON file, and respond with the string format. The output json object should follow this format:
{
    "task_description": "map_create_waypoint",
    "decision":
    {
            "criteria": "The map must be open with the 'Saloon' marked as a Waypoint, and then the map must be closed to indicate the task completion.",
            "reasoning": "Both provided images show the in-game character standing near a campfire, with the mini-map visible on the bottom left corner. The mini-map does not provide sufficient information to determine if the 'Saloon' has been marked as a Waypoint via the Index, nor do these images show the main map being closed after marking a Waypoint. We can not see any waypoint marker on the mini-map nor any actions related to opening or navigating the full map.",
            "success": false
    }
}
