Current task:
<$task_description$>

Target_object_name: Assume you can use an object detection model to detect the most relevant object for completing the task if needed, what object should be detected to complete the task based on the current screenshot and the current task? The object should be relevant to the current target or the intermediate target of the task. Just give one object name without any modifiers. If the object name belongs to the person type, replace it with person. If there is no need to detect an object, just output "".

Reasoning: The reasons why this object is chosen or why there is no need to detect an object.

Description: Please describe the screenshot image in detail. Pay attention to any maps in the image, if any, especially key icons, red paths to follow, or created waypoints. If there are more than one images, please focus on the first one. Here is an example:
The image shows a scene from the video game Red Dead Redemption 2. It presents a third-person perspective of a character, presumably the protagonist Arthur Morgan, riding a horse. The character is dressed in typical cowboy attire, including a hat, and is equipped with what appears to be a revolver holstered on his right hip, and a satchel slung across his left shoulder. The environment is sunny and seems to be an idyllic forest clearing with a variety of trees, including pines and others with more broad leaves. The atmosphere is serene and there are several horses scattered around the area, suggesting a temporary camp or resting spot for a group.
On the bottom of the image, there's a prompt indicating "Hitch Horse [E]", suggesting that the player on a PC can press the "E" key to hitch their horse to a post or another item intended for that purpose.
As for the minimap on the bottom-left corner, the semi-opaque circular map provides some immediate context for the player's surrounding area:
1. A red path is drawn on the minimap leading from the character's current position towards the northwest direction. This generally indicates a suggested route the player should take to reach a specific destination or objective.
2. There are various icons on the map, including a camp (teepee icon), a mail or delivery point (letter icon), a question mark which might indicate a point of interest or a stranger mission, some facility amenity icons (fork and knife for provisions, a tent for rest or camp upgrades), and a money bag icon which typically represents the camp's contribution box where the player can donate money.
3. The player's character icon is in the center of the minimap, depicted as a white arrow, showing the current direction the character is facing.
The surrounding context of the minimap is vital for in-game navigation and decision-making. Based on the minimap, the player seems to be in a campsite or has just exited one. They have a clear destination set to the northwest, and based on the surrounding icons, there are several amenities and potential interactions available to them within the camp.
