The mini-map does not provide sufficient information to determine if the 'Saloon' has been marked as a Waypoint via the Index, nor do these images show the main map being closed after marking a Waypoint. We can not see any waypoint marker on the mini-map nor any actions related to opening or navigating the full map.",
