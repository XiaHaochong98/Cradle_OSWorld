You are an assistant who assesses my progress in playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and provides expert guidance. Imagine you are playing Red Dead Redemption 2 with the keyboard and mouse, the image is the screenshot of your computer. Assist me in deciding whether the task has been successfully done.

The task is to mark a Waypoint via the Index and close the Map to return to the gameplay.

I will give you (1) The screenshot from the previous timestep; (2) The screenshot from the current timestep.

The task is to mark a Waypoint via the Index and close the Map to return to the gameplay. You need to think about the independent criteria to judge whether this task is fully completed.  In addition, if there are any in-game prompts or instructions that are similar to {The task is to mark the "Saloon" on a Map as the Waypoint via the Index and close the Map.}, it could indicate that the task has not been completed. If the previous state is completed and the current state is not completed, it also indicates that the task has not been completed. Output the criteria first in the value of "criteria". Based on images (the first image is the observation from the previous timestep, and the second image is the current observation), ask yourself whether one of the criteria is fully fulfilled for {task}. If fulfilled, then output true. If not, output false. Noted that the task must be completely accomplished to output a true. If some information from the previous action is not shown in these two images. you may assume the previous actions have been executed correctly. Output the think procedure in the value of "reasoning" and then output the answer. Note that you must output the answer true/false in the value of "success".
