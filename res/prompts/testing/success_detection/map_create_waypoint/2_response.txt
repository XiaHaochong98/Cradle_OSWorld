Checking if the 'Saloon' entry in the index is highlighted or selected. \n2. Verifying that a waypoint marker has been placed on the 'Saloon' location on the map. \n3. Confirming that the map has been closed.",
      "reasoning": "The current index selection is on 'Player', and this does not correspond to the 'Saloon'. Also, there is no visible waypoint marker on the map indicating that the 'Saloon' has been marked as a waypoint. Furthermore, the map is still open in the current image.",
