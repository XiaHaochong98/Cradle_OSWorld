      "criteria": "To determine success for the task 'mark the Saloon on a Map as the Waypoint via the Index and close the Map', the criteria are: (1) The Index must have 'Saloon' selected on the map, (2) A waypoint marker should be visible on the map at the location of the Saloon, and (3) The map must be closed to complete the task.",
      "reasoning": "The provided screenshots indicate that the player has selected 'Ammunition' in the first image and 'Provisions' in the second image from the index, neither of which are the 'Saloon'. Also, no waypoint marker is set at the Saloon location on the map, and the map has not been closed. Therefore, the task has not been completed.",
