You are an assistant who assesses my progress in playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and provides expert guidance. Imagine you are playing Red Dead Redemption 2 with the keyboard and mouse, the image is the screenshot of your computer. Assist me in making a decision to complete a game task.

The task is to mark the "Saloon" on a Map as the Waypoint via the Index and close the Map to return to the gameplay. You should only output one skill.

I will give you extra information retrieved from memory and gathered from the game, you may use them to help your decision, but neglect them if they are empty.

Decomposed "mark the "Saloon" on a Map as the Waypoint via the Index and close the Map to return to the gameplay. You should only output one skill" to multiple automatic skills based on skills description, and choose some of them to finish the task. The skills you can choose are:

Based on the above input, including input images (the first is from the last two timesteps, and the second is from the last timestep), what should be the next steps? You should think step-by-step, and give your reasoning process in the value of "reasoning". The number of skills you can include in the "skill_steps" mus obey the requirement in {mark the "Saloon" on a Map as the Waypoint via the Index and close the Map to return to the gameplay. You should only choose one skill}. Fill the "skill_steps" with the sequence of functions you chose to perform, if the function has a parameter, you should also decide the parameter for it. You should only output a JSON file without other explanation and respond with the string format. Your output should be in the following format:

{
    "type": "decision_making",
    "skill_steps": "```python
    # The reasoning process of your decision
    skill_1(arg1,arg2) # the skill you choose from the skill list and its parameters
    skill_2() # the skill you choose from the skill list that does not have parameter
    ```"
    ,
    "reasoning": "summary of the reasoning to chose the action or sequence of actions"
 }
