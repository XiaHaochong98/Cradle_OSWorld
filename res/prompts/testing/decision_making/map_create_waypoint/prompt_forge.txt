You are an assistant who assesses my progress in playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and provides expert guidance. Imagine you are playing Red Dead Redemption 2 with the keyboard and mouse, the image is the screenshot of your computer. Assist me in making a decision to complete a game task.

I will give you extra information retrieved from memory and gathered from the game, you may use them to help your decision, but neglect them if they are empty.

Memory:

Gathered_information:

You should decompose the task to multiple automatic skills based on the skills description, and choose some of them to finish the task. The skills you can choose are:

Based on the above input, including input images (the first is from the last two timesteps, and the second is from the last timestep). What should be the next steps? You should think step-by-step, and give your reasoning process in the value of "reasoning". Your task is to mark the "General Store" on a Map as the Waypoint via the Index and close the Map to return to the game. You should only output one skill. The maximum number of skills you can include in the "skill_steps" is according to the task description if specified. Fill the "skill_steps" with the sequence of functions you chose to perform, if the function has a parameter, you should also decide the parameter for it, if it does not have a parameter just leave an empty "params". Output an empty "skill_steps" list if no action needs to be taken further. Your output should be in the following format:

{
        "type": "decision_making",
        "skill_steps": [
            {
                "name": "action1",
                "description": "action1 description",
                "params": {
 		    "args1": args1_value,
                    "args2": args2_value
		}
            },
            {
                "name": "action2",
                "description": "action2 description",
                "params": {}
            }
        ],
        "reason": "summary of the reason to chose the action or sequence of actions"
  }

 You should only output a JSON file without other explanation, do not give a markdown of a JSON file.
