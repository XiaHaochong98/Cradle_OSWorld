     "context": "The image shows a scene from the video game Red Dead Redemption 2. It presents a third-person perspective of a character, presumably the protagonist Arthur Morgan, riding a horse. The character is dressed in typical cowboy attire, including a hat, and is equipped with what appears to be a revolver holstered on his right hip, and a satchel slung across his left shoulder. The environment is sunny and seems to be an idyllic forest clearing with a variety of trees, including pines and others with more broad leaves. The atmosphere is serene and there are several horses scattered around the area, suggesting a temporary camp or resting spot for a group.\n\nOn the bottom of the image, there's a prompt indicating \"Hitch Horse [E]\", suggesting that the player on a PC can press the \"E\" key to hitch their horse to a post or another item intended for that purpose.\n\nAs for the minimap on the bottom-left corner, the semi-opaque circular map provides some immediate context for the player's surrounding area:\n\n1. A red path is drawn on the minimap leading from the character's current position towards the northwest direction. This generally indicates a suggested route the player should take to reach a specific destination or objective.\n2. There are various icons on the map, including a camp (teepee icon), a mail or delivery point (letter icon), a question mark which might indicate a point of interest or a stranger mission, some facility amenity icons (fork and knife for provisions, a tent for rest or camp upgrades), and a money bag icon which typically represents the camp's contribution box where the player can donate money.\n3. The player's character icon is in the center of the minimap, depicted as a white arrow, showing the current direction the character is facing.\n\nThe surrounding context of the minimap is vital for in-game navigation and decision-making. Based on the minimap, the player seems to be in a campsite or has just exited one. They have a clear destination set to the northwest, and based on the surrounding icons, there are several amenities and potential interactions available to them within the camp.\n",
