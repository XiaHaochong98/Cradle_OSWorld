    "user_prompt-001": "Task Description:\nYour task is to analyze and interpret a screenshot from a video game, focusing on understanding and describing the underlying events and relationships depicted within it. This involves going beyond mere object detection to delve into the semantics of the scene, capturing the dynamics, and interactions suggested by the screenshot. Your analysis will be used in conjunction with the OpenAI Embedding model and stored for future retrieval. You are provided with object detection results from the screenshot as a starting point for your analysis.\n\nInput Provided:\nThe input will consist of object detection results from the video game screenshot. This includes identifying characters, items, and environmental aspects. Use this information as a foundation to infer and elaborate on the interactions, relationships, and events taking place in the screenshot.\n\nYour output must follow the following rules:\n(1) Your response should be concise. Do not elaborate on every detail.\n(2) Your response should be easy to understand.\n(3) The objective provided in the input is not of the same importance. Instead of elaborating on all the details, you should emphasize the semantic richer objects\n(4) You should make the response more narrative like telling a story. Your response should be a semantic analysis of the screenshot, emphasizing the narrative, interactions, and relationships among the identified elements. Describe the scene in a way that conveys the storyline, character dynamics, and the overall context.\n(5) Structure your description to be easily interpretable by the OpenAI Embedding model, ensuring it is rich in context and meaningful for effective future retrieval.\n(6) Your response should only be the content of the screenshot, do not include any explanation and justification in your response. \n(7) Your output should be a JSON file with the format of:\n{\n  \"type\": \"description\",\n  \"objects\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"description\",\n      \"value\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nInput:",
