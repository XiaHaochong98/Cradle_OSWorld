    "prompt": "The screenshot is a map describing the game world. On the left side of the screenshot, there is an index listing all the possible places to be chosen as the waypoint.\n\nThe index lists all the possible places in a sequential manner, the top ranks 0 while the last one ranks n where n is a positive number. The selected place is marked with a red box. Your task is to calculate the distance of the target place to the current selected place on the index list.\n\nThe distance is calculated by the following formula: distance = (target_rank - current_rank). For example, if the current selected place ranks 3 and the target place ranks 5, then the distance is 2. If the current selected place ranks 8 and the target place ranks 3, then the distance is -5.\n\nIf the target place is not on the index list, then you should assume its rank to be n+1. For example, if the current selected place ranks 3 and the target place is not on the index list, and the list has 10 places, then the distance of the target place is 10 and the distance is 7.\n\nYour input contains a screenshot of the map containing the index list and text of the target place. Your output should be a JSON file that contains the distance of the target place to the current selected place. The JSON file should be in the following format:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"map_create_waypoint\",\n  \"objects\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"value\",\n      \"name\": \"distantce_to_target\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"\"\n      \"value\": '1',\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n\n(1) You should first list all the place and their rank to calculate the distance. You should summarize the places and their rank in \"reasoning\". You should use this information to decide the distance. You should not output the detailed place and their rank in the output JSON.\n(2) The output should only be a JSON file that wraps all JSON of objects. You should not add any other explanation text along with the JSON.\n\nInput:\ntarget_place: \"\"",
