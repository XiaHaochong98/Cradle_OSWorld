# UAC
Repository for the Universal Agent Control project.


Please setup your environment as:
```bash
conda create --name uac-dev python=3.10
conda activate uac-dev
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Keep the requirements.txt file updated in your branch, but only add dependencies that are really required by the system.

runner.py is the entry point to run an agent. Currently not working code, just an introductory sample.
